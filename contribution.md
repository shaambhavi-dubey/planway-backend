4. Test your feature thoroughly in a local environment.

**When creating a PR:**

* Provide a **clear and descriptive title**.
* Explain **what problem** your PR solves and **how** you solved it.
* Mention related issues (e.g., `Closes #123`).
* Attach **screenshots or screen recordings** for any UI/UX changes.
* Keep PRs small; large changes should be broken into multiple PRs.
